/* The project is created to learn various aspects of C++ programing. The project uses object oriented programing.
   It also uses concept of dynamic memory allocation. The program uses dynamic array as main data structure to
   create read update and delete data of an Employee. The program also uses File Handling to store the data of
   Employees. There is also use of Enumerations for better data management. Also the project has basic use of exceptions
   to handle special cases.  Overall the project is just an attempt to learn C++ programing
